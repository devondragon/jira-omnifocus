# JIRA-OmniFocus Sync Configuration
# 
# SECURITY RECOMMENDATION: Use macOS Keychain for credentials instead of this file!
# 
# To set up Keychain storage (recommended):
#   1. Run: security add-internet-password -a YOUR_USERNAME -s example.atlassian.net -w YOUR_API_TOKEN
#   2. Set 'keychain: true' below
#   3. Remove the 'username' and 'password' fields
#
# For JIRA Cloud, use an API token instead of your password:
#   Create one at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens
